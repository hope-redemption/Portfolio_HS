Supervised by Dr. Faez Ahmed in DeCoDE lab, MIT         

Project Description:
Target: 
Aimed to build a multi-modal learning model that can learn car design data in multiple modes effectively to predict car performance.
Content:
Learned and mastered deep learning algorithms for different data types to expand deep learning knowledge and skills.
Learned and mastered the evolution of multi-modal learning (origin, development, challenges, future research directions).
Explored and implemented the relevant deep learning algorithms for unimodal data (e.g., images, text, sketches, tabular data) with Tensorflow.
Built a multi-modal learning model based on the image data and Tabular data that can learn car design data in multiple modes effectively to predict car performance.
