Feb 2021 - May 2021
Project Description:
Target:
Aimed to design and manufacture a linkage foot robot (driven by a single motor) with a reduction gearbox.
Content:
led the whole team to successfully design the robot model that gave attention to many details, such as designing the motion scheme, designing and printing individual parts, assembly, and optimization design. 
Individually responsible for the design of the motion scheme, and in the later stage the optimization design of the overall aesthetics and mechanical properties. 
The final team's robot walked the straightest and steadiest
