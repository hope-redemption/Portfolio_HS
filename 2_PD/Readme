C++ version software program for parameter identification
Jun 2021 â€“ Aug 2021
Supervised by Dr. Mingguo Zhao in Automatic Laboratory, Tsinghua University & UBTECH

Project Description:
Target: 
Aimed to develop a C++ version based on MATLAB identification software.
Content:
Read the relevant theoretical literature on parameter identification and calibration and mastered the content of the algorithm. 
Studied and mastered the general process of parameter identification: establishment of the dynamic model, equation linearization, design of incentive trajectory, and data collection.
Analyzed the functions of the original software and learned C language programming from scratch, the configuration and use of various mathematical libraries, and optimized libraries.
Wrote the C++ version code of the dynamic parameter optimization and cross-validation part of the software program to make it open source, based on the MATLAB version of the software program. 
Applied a nonlinear optimization library (NLOPT) into the C++ version project to make the optimization algorithm more effective and efficient 
Visualized the dynamic parameter optimization process data, and drew related images for display. 
Finished the project with more than 3000 lines of source code and improved my ability to write code.
