Project 1: Composite Image Generation & Binary Image Classification (group project)    Oct 2021 – Nov 2021
Project Description:
Target:
To develop, evaluate and report image processing software to automatically create various types of composite images, using automatically selected images as specific categories of the scene.
Content:
Implemented the two basic parts of synthetic image generation and binary image classification (natural scenery or artificial scenery) using machine learning methods
Combined the above two parts to automatically determine which picture belongs to after selecting a specific picture category, and generate a composite image. 
Used python to construct a neural network to achieve the binary classification of pictures, and the accuracy became 85% during the tests.

Project 2: Classification and Clustering (individual project)    Nov 2021 – Dec 2021
Project Description:
Content:
Implemented two methods: PCA and LDA to achieve the dimensionality reduction by using the first two principal components.
Visualized data from MNIST and compared the clustering results after dimensionality reduction. 
Used SVM with an RBF kernel, SVM with a linear kernel, and a neural network classifier with one hidden layer to classify the dataset in a 5-fold cross-validation setting.
Create and plot the ROC curves of the results using the three different classifiers, and compare their performance using the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
