5 Simulation of catching and throwing objects between two separate robots in motion (group project)
Robot Manipulation (Instructor: Russ Tedrake), MIT                                Oct 2022 - Dec 2022
•	Aimed to build a physics-based throwing using inverse dynamics control to simulate two robots throwing and catching a simple object back and forth repeatedly
•	Implemented the algorithms for throwing trajectory planning and movement strategy of the iiwa robot arm
•	Studied the background, implementation, basic principle, and application of throwing and catching problems
