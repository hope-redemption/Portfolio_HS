Robot Manipulation (Instructor: Russ Tedrake), MIT                                Oct 2022 - Dec 2022
•	Aim to culminate in a simulated demonstration of these robots throwing and catching a simple object back and forth repeatedly in which the catching robot will have to move 
•	Study the background, implementation, basic principle, and application of throwing and catching problems based on relevant papers
•	Attempt to replicate at least one successful throw and catch on real-world hardware if time permits.
