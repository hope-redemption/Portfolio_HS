5 Simulation of catching and throwing objects between two separate robots in motion (group project)
Robot Manipulation (Instructor: Russ Tedrake), MIT                                Oct 2022 - Dec 2022
•Aimed to build a physics-based throwing using inverse dynamics control to simulate two robots throwing and catching a simple object back and forth repeatedly
•Implemented the algorithms for throwing trajectory planning and movement strategy of the iiwa robot arm
•Studied the background, implementation, basic principle, and application of throwing and catching problems
