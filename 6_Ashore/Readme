Project description:
Target
•	Our product: Ashore, which is designed to be placed around sea turtle nests to rectify the sex ratio imbalance of sea turtles caused by rising global temperatures. 

Content:
•	The device cools sea turtle nests until they reach 27 ℃ which will produce 100% male hatchlings to help rectify the sex ratio imbalance.
•	Our device is designed for marine conservation groups that specialize in sea turtle conservation. 
•	On the first day, conservationists find new sea turtle nests and will place the eggs inside the housing before reburying it. 
•	On day 20, the eggs will reach their critical development phase and the user will attach the Ashore pump to the inlet valve above the sand and begins the process of filling the reservoir with up to 4 gallons of 0℃ water. 
•	From Day 20 to Day 40, volunteers will replenish the ice water in the cooler every 8 days to allow the system to maintain its internal temperature difference. 
•	On day 40, the conservationists return again. They dig back down to the top of the incubator and remove the lid. This process does not disturb the turtle eggs and allows them to hatch unimpeded.
•	After day 60, the sea turtles have hatched and left the nest, and the conservationists return one final time to recover the incubator from the sand.  
•	In the off-season, our product can be disassembled and stored for later use.
